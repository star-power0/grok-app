 * identical**. Async work started on one draft (materialize + `sessionConnect`,
 * which can take seconds) would compare `null === null`, conclude the user was
 * still on its own view, and yank the workbench back to the chat it just
 * started — right as the agent began executing. The epoch gives each draft an
 * identity so that comparison fails.
 *
 * Rule for any async path that touches view state: capture the focus **before**
 * the first `await`, and re-check it before writing.
